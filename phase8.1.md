## üîÑ Implementation Details

### Service Layer Architecture
```go
type ReportService struct {
    db ReportQuerier
}

// Core reporting methods implemented:
- GetBorrowingStatistics(ctx, startDate, endDate, yearOfStudy)
- GetOverdueBooks(ctx, yearOfStudy, department)
- GetPopularBooks(ctx, startDate, endDate, limit, yearOfStudy)
- GetStudentActivity(ctx, yearOfStudy, department, startDate, endDate)
- GetInventoryStatus(ctx)
- GetLibraryOverview(ctx)
- GetBorrowingTrends(ctx, startDate, endDate, interval)
- GetYearlyComparison(ctx, years)
```

### Database Query Highlights
- **Complex Aggregations**: Monthly borrowing statistics with student counts
- **Time-based Analytics**: Flexible date truncation for trends (day/week/month/year)
- **Conditional Filtering**: Optional year and department filtering
- **Statistical Calculations**: Growth rates, utilization percentages, averages
- **Performance Optimization**: Proper indexing support and efficient joins

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Report generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "monthly_data": [...],
    "summary": {
      "total_borrows": 1200,
      "total_returns": 1150,
      "total_overdue": 50
    },
    "generated_at": "2024-01-20T10:30:00+03:00"
  }
}
```
